Regular Expression in Python:

import re (Built-in Module)
1. re.match()
2. re.search()
3. re.sub()
4. re.find()
5. re.findall()
6. re.compile()
7. re.split()

str="Welcome"
str="/^[A-Z][a-z][0-9]*$/" *: may be not or may be 1 time or may be more time
str="/^(0-9){3,7}$/"

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match
or find other strings or sets of strings using a specialized syntax held in a
pattern.

match(): it always match at starting string position and do not match at the
middle or the end of the string.
syntax: re.match(pattern,string,flags=0)
groups(): This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there
weren't any.

def main():
    line="i think that i understand the reg ex"
    match_result=re.match(r'I think',line,re.M|re.I)
    #match_result=re.match(r'think',line,re.M|re.I)
    if match_result:
        print("Match found: " + match_result.group())
    else:
        print("No Match found")
main()


'''
search(): This function searches for first occurence of RE pattern within string with optional
flags. syntax: re.search(pattern,stri\ng,flags=0) match checks for a match only at the beginning
of the string while search checks for a match anywhere in the string.

'''

def main():
    line="i think that i understand the reg ex"
    search_result=re.search(r'Think',line,re.M|re.I)
    if search_result:
        print("Search found: " +search_result.group())
    else:
        print("Search not found")
main()

'''
Search, Replace and Remove using sub() function: This method replaces all occurences of the RE
pattern in string with repl, substituting all occurences unless max provided. This method returns
modified string. syntax: re.sub(pattern,repl,string)
